# Elevator Distance

Imagine you start on the 5th floor of a building, then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 8th floor. You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.

Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order.
